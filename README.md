## Options

To use this extension you need to provide your Cloud instance SubDomain in the Options.

## Search query

You can use # to prefix for labels.
If you enter multiple labels, it will search by labels with an AND combination. (Contrary to the built-in Confluence Advance Search which search by OR combination.)

## Space Key

You can enter multiple space keys separated by a comma (,). In this case it will search in the different spaces i.e. with an OR combination.
If you enter no space key it searches in your whole Confluence instance.

## Additional functionality

Some additional features are built-in in the Context Menu.

When you have a Confluence page opened in edit mode, you can access some functions via the Context menu (Right-Mouse Click). There are grouped under the extension menu "Confluence".

### Numbering Headings

You can add or remove numbering to headings using the corresponding menu entries.
